# Star Wars Survey

The objective of this project is to observe and examine data collected from Star Wars Movies surveys. 
The survey consist of over 800 responses and was colllected by a team from a blog called FiveThirtyEight.
The questions that were looked into included:
- "Does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?" 
- "Do Star Trek fans also love Star Wars movies?" 

Data Cleaning and Explorating Data Analysis were conducted in a Jupyter notebook. 

Interested observations were discovered as noted below: 
- Star Trek fans had stronger reactions to the Star Wars movies. They ranked movies 1-3 lower than a non-Star Trek fan and ranked movies 4-6 higher than a non-Star Trek fan.
- Most of the audience who watched Star Wars movies are fans of Star Trek.
